# SeleniumAutomatedInstaBot
Developed a Selenium-based automated bot using PyCharm, designed to proactively engage with users by sending automated messages and managing friend requests. This versatile bot enhances user engagement and attracts new followers by autonomously interacting with the platform's community.

How to use the bot:

create an account, or have an instagram account which you would like to use to send automatic replies

Clone the repository in the directory of your choosing:

$ git clone https://github.com/SharuSiv/SeleniumAutomatedInstaBot

change directory into the cloned directory

$ cd SeleniumAutomatedInstaBot

open the project in an IDE of your choice (I used PyCharm for this project)
